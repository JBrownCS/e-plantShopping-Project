<h1 style="text-align: center" >Plant Nursery Shopping Page Project</h1>
<p>
This repository was my final project for the IBM Developing Front-End Apps with React course on Coursera. This is a single page React application for selling plants of different categories online. The site consists of multiple React Components using Redux for state management. Users can browse the different plants, view their descriptions and costs, and add them to the cart. The checkout feature will be updated at a future date. The plant pictures were provided by Pixabay. You can go to https://jbrowncs.github.io/e-plantShopping-Project/ to see the deployed page.
